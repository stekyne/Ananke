Audio Widgets TODO list
------------------------

This project will serve as a front end interface to generate control data 
for audio related projects. Audio Widgets will generate the control data 
used for synthesis. For example, envelopes to control cutoff/resonance.

Widgets to add:
[] Wrapper component with inputs and outputs shown
[] ADSR envelopes
[] LFO
